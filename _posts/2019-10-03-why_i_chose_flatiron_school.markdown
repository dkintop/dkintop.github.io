As a kid, just graduating highschool and having to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, I had no clue what I was goint to do. I initially thought I wanted to do something to help people, something people would be grateful of and thank me for. I also had an interest in science and exercise, so I decided that a career in physical therapy was what I would go for. I decided against going for my doctorate to become a Physical Therapist due to the high cost of school and relatively poor income to debt ratio of new graduates. I then decided that I would get mmy associates degree as a Physical Therapist Assistant. Unfortunately I came to the conclusion that, for me, this was not the career I had imagined it to be. Culturally healthcare in general, especially the long term care setting that I worked in, is horrible. It was killing me slowly and changing me into a person that I couldn't stand. 

I began researching different options. I had no idea what to do, and every option I came across seemed like it had too many negatives such as high cost for education, several year long curriculums, and no career support afterward. I thought it was going to be impossible to find another option at this point in my life, but on one gloomy afternoon, the google algorithm gods showed me a link that would change everything. 

When I first clicked the link to Flatiron schools website and read all of the reviews and everything that they had to offer I honestly thought it was a scam. Only five months? Same price as one semester at my old college? Money back guarantee if no job? To be honest, I didn't even consider it seriously at first, but it gave me the idea to try my hand at coding. I started using free education websites like freecodecamp and flatiron schools bootcamp prep course, and I was hooked. Right away I was putting in more hours coding than I was at the job that was paying me. After about 3 months of self teaching I decided I wanted to pursue Flat Iron a bit further, so I officially applied for the online software engineering structured program. Within a few days I had an admissions interview and was immediately impressed with the professional yet kind and welcoming attitude of my interviewer. A week later I received the good news that I was accepted into the program. I am now one month into the curriculum and could not be happier with my decision and I am 100% confident that this is the best choice I have ever made.

Long story short, if you are reading this and you are on the fence about applying ask yourself only two questions. Do you truly enjoy coding? Do you have it in you to put in the hours that the program requires (about 40-60 hours a week)? If the answer is yes to both of those questions, then look no further, because I really do not think you can go wrong with Flatiron School.
